As shown in the time series visualization, there were significant changes in air quality levels throughout the time period of the analysis.

This suggests a govenment policy change. 

The Training set for the ARIMA Model was the data from the Month of October 2019.

The Target prediction was November 1st, 2019.

The Baseline Mean Absolute Error of the model was 8.08.

The Mean Absolute Error from the Test Data with walk-forward validation was 8.76.
